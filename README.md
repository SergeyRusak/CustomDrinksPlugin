# CustomDrinksPlugin
Plugin for Spigot Minecraft server version 1.16.5
This plugin adds the feature to create drinks like when you create this in the visual novel Va-11 Hall-a by Sukeban Games
   
Any drink is created from a combination of five main ingredients (Adelhyde, Flanergide, Bronson Extract, Powered Delta, and Karmotrine) and additional parameters (adding "rocks", blending the drink without mixing, and aging the drink after preparation).
If everything is done correctly and the ratio of the ingredients equals the recipe for one of the drinks, then a bottle with the desired drink will fall into the player's hand. Otherwise, in the player's hand will appear a bottle with "Messed up drink"
